# Construction
This is a construction simulation game, part of my final year project.

In this game, you play the role of a project manager, and your goal is to minimize project time and cost of a simulated project through optimizing labor allocation strategies.

You can download the game [here](https://github.com/zhuyidiwow/Construction/releases/tag/alpha).
